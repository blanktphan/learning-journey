## üí° Basic knowledge required

- A deep understanding of Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and their O(n) imbalance weakness (from lesson 3.2).

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Define a "Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree" and its goal of maintaining logarithmic height.
- Understand the concept of "Tree Rotation" as the fundamental rebalancing mechanism.
- Describe the balancing property of an AVL Tree (subtree heights differ by at most 1).
- Describe the balancing property of a Red-Black Tree (using colors and specific rules).
- Compare the conceptual trade-offs between AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees.

### 1. Introduction: The Imbalance Problem and Its Solution

From the last lesson, we found that the O(log n) performance of a BST only occurs if the tree is balanced. If we insert sorted data, the tree degenerates into a structure resembling a Linked List, and performance drops to O(n).

A **Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree** is a special type of BST designed to **automatically rebalance itself** after every insertion or deletion. This guarantees that the tree's height always remains in the O(log n) range.

The primary mechanism these trees use to rebalance is the **Tree Rotation**. This is a local operation that rearranges a subtree by swapping a parent-child pair to decrease the tree's height while always preserving the BST's ordering property.

```
    y           x
   / \         / \
  x   C  <=>  A   y
 / \             / \
A   B           B   C
(A right rotation on y)
```

### 2. AVL Trees: The Strict Balancer

Named after its inventors, Adelson-Velsky and Landis (1962), this was the world's first self-balancing BST.

**Balancing Property (The AVL Property):**
-   For every node in the tree, the heights of its left and right subtrees can differ by at most 1.

**How it works:** After every insertion or deletion, the algorithm checks the "Balance Factor" of nodes up the tree towards the root. If any node's balance factor becomes +2 or -2 (meaning its subtrees' heights differ by 2), a tree rotation is performed at that node to restore the balance.

**Pros and Cons:**
-   **Pro:** Because the rules are very strict, the resulting tree is highly balanced (as short as possible). This makes **searches the fastest**.
-   **Con:** This strictness can make **insertions and deletions slower**, as they may require multiple rotations to maintain the balance.

### 3. Red-Black Trees: The Flexible Balancer

This is another highly popular self-balancing BST used in practice. It uses a different balancing method: assigning a "color" (Red or Black) to every node and enforcing a set of 5 complex rules.

**Balancing Properties (Red-Black Properties):**
1.  Every node is either Red or Black.
2.  The root is always Black.
3.  All leaves (NIL nodes) are Black.
4.  If a node is Red, then both its children must be Black (no two Red nodes can be adjacent).
5.  Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes contains the same number of Black nodes.

**How it works:** These five rules work together to guarantee that the longest path in the tree is no more than twice as long as the shortest path. This is sufficient to keep the tree's height at O(log n). Rebalancing occurs through **tree rotations** and **re-coloring nodes**.

**Pros and Cons:**
-   **Pro:** Its balance is more "relaxed" than an AVL tree's. This makes **insertions and deletions faster** on average because fewer rotations are required.
-   **Con:** Searches can be slightly slower than in an AVL tree because the tree can be slightly taller.

**Practical Use:** This balance of performance makes the Red-Black Tree the implementation of choice for many standard library data structures, such as `map` and `set` in C++ and `TreeMap` in Java.

## üìã Comprehensive Summary & Practical Exercise

### Comprehensive Summary

Self-Balancing BSTs solve the worst-case scenario of a regular BST by using **rotations** to guarantee O(log n) performance. **AVL Trees** are strictly balanced, making them fast for searching but slower for modifications. **Red-Black Trees** are more flexible, making them faster for modifications but slightly slower for searching.

### Practical Exercise

You are designing the database for two systems:
1.  An online dictionary where word data is inserted once, and after that, operations are almost exclusively "searches."
2.  A real-time stock tracking system where new price data is constantly being "inserted."

For each system, would you choose an AVL Tree or a Red-Black Tree as the underlying data structure? Why?
