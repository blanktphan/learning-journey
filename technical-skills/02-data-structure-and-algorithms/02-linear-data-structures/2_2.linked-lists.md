# üìñ Topic: Linked Lists

## üí° Basic knowledge required

- Understanding the performance limitations of arrays, especially for insertion/deletion (from lesson 2.1).
- Understanding the concept of pointers or memory references.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Define a "Linked List" and its main component, the "Node."
- Explain how a linked list can store data non-contiguously in memory.
- Analyze the time complexity (Big O) of linked list operations and compare them to arrays.
- Differentiate between a Singly Linked List and a Doubly Linked List.

### 1. Introduction: Solving the Weakness of Arrays

From the previous lesson, we know that a major weakness of arrays is the inefficiency of inserting or deleting elements at the beginning or in the middle (O(n)), which requires shifting all subsequent elements.

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure specifically designed to solve this problem. Instead of storing data in a contiguous block of memory, it stores data in separate **Nodes**, which can be scattered anywhere in memory.

### 2. Anatomy of a Linked List

A **Node** is the most basic component of a linked list. Each node stores two pieces of information:
-   **Data:** The actual value we want to store (e.g., a number, a string).
-   **Pointer (or Next):** A reference that stores the "memory address" of the **next** node in the sequence. The last node in the list has a pointer to `null`, indicating the end.

```
 A Node:
+------+-------+
| Data | Next  |
+------+-------+
         |
         v
         (Address of
         next node)
```

The entire linked list structure is a collection of nodes "chained" together by these pointers. The list variable itself only needs to store one piece of information: a pointer to the very first node, which we call the **Head**.

```
 Head
  |
  v
+---+---+   +---+---+   +---+----+
| A | --|-->| B | --|-->| C |null|
+---+---+   +---+---+   +---+----+
```

Analogy: A linked list is like a "treasure hunt." Each "clue" (Node) contains some "treasure information" (Data) and a "map to the next clue" (Pointer). We only need to know the location of the "first clue" (Head) to follow the trail to the end. The clues themselves can be hidden anywhere.

### 3. Performance Analysis: The Key Trade-off

The performance of a linked list is essentially the opposite of an array's.

-   **Access: `get(i)`**
    -   Time Complexity: **O(n) (Linear Time)**
    -   This is the **biggest weakness** of a linked list. To access the i-th element, we cannot jump to it directly. We must start at the `Head` and "walk" through the pointers one node at a time for `i` steps.

-   **Search:**
    -   Time Complexity: **O(n) (Linear Time)**
    -   Similar to access, we must look at each node from the beginning.

-   **Insertion/Deletion (at the Head):**
    -   Time Complexity: **O(1) (Constant Time)**
    -   This is the **biggest strength** of a linked list. We just create a new node and adjust one or two pointers (e.g., `new_node.next = head; head = new_node;`). The rest of the list is untouched.

### 4. Variations of Linked Lists

-   **Singly Linked List:** The basic form where each node has only one pointer to the `next` node. We can only traverse forward.
-   **Doubly Linked List:** Each node has two pointers: `next` (points forward) and `previous` (points backward).
    -   **Pros:** Allows for traversing both forward and backward. Makes deleting a specific node easier.
    -   **Cons:** Uses more memory per node and has slightly more complex pointer management for insertions/deletions.

## üìã Comprehensive Summary & Practical Exercise

### Comprehensive Summary

A linked list stores data in nodes connected by pointers, allowing for very fast O(1) insertion/deletion at the head. This comes at the cost of slow O(n) access and search, as it requires traversing the list from the beginning. It represents a clear performance trade-off compared to an array.

### Practical Exercise

From the last lesson, we considered building an "Undo" system for a text editor. Why is a **linked list** a more suitable data structure than an **array** for this problem? (Hint: What part of the data sequence do Undo/Redo operations affect?)
