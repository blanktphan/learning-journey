# üìñ How is the programming process done?

The general programming process consists of the following steps:

1.  Understand the Problem: Analyze the requirements to determine what the program must be capable of doing.
2.  Design the Algorithm: Plan the problem-solving process in clear, step-by-step procedures (using computational thinking skills).
3.  Choose Language & Tools: Select the appropriate programming language for the task (e.g., Python for AI, JavaScript for web development) and tools (e.g., Text Editor, Git).
4.  Write the Code: Convert an algorithm into code according to the syntax of the selected language.
5.  Test and Debug: Verify that the program functions correctly according to the design and fix any bugs found.
6.  Deploy & Maintain: Install the program for users to use in real-world scenarios and continuously improve and fix issues or address new requirements as they arise.
