# üìñ What is Programming?

Programming is the process of planning, designing, and writing a sequence of instructions for a computer or electronic device to perform a desired task.

- Computer programs such as Discord and Notion, among others.
- Websites such as YouTube and Gmail, among others.
- Mobile applications such as Facebook and Messenger, for example.

 These are just some of the results that can be achieved through programming. There are still many things that can be created, such as the Internet of Things and video games.
