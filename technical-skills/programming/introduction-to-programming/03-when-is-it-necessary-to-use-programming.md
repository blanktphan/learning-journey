# üìñ When is it necessary to use programming?

We use programming to make digital systems work logically and systematically. For example:

1.  When you want to create something new, such as an e-commerce website, a fitness application, or a new game.
2.  When there is an existing problem, such as a slow and error-prone inventory management system, a new program must be written to improve it.
3.  When working with data, you may need to analyze customer behavior from millions of transactions.
4.  When you need to control hardware, such as programming robots, drones, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices to operate according to specified conditions.
