## 📖 Programming: Why is it important?

Programming is important because it is a tool for creating and solving problems in the digital age. For example:

1.  To solve the problem, create a program that will help make life and work easier.
2.  To automate tasks, manage repetitive tasks as automated processes to save time and reduce errors.
3.  To analyze and understand data, we write programs to process massive amounts of data (big data) to identify trends, create financial models, and train AI, among other things.
4.  To drive innovation, technology has transformed nearly everything, from self-driving cars to telemedicine. All of these advancements are fundamentally based on programming.
