### Introduction: The Need for Architecture

Database systems are highly complex. To manage this complexity, a standard architecture was created to **separate** the system into **layers** with clear, independent responsibilities. The ultimate goal is to achieve **Data Independence**, which is the ability to modify the structure in one layer without affecting the layers above it.

### The ANSI-SPARC Three-Schema Architecture

This is the most widely accepted standard architectural model, consisting of three levels:

#### 1. External Level / View Level
-   **Description:** This is the level closest to the **end-user**. It represents the **view** of each user or user group towards the database, which may only show a portion of the data relevant to them.
-   **Example:** In a university database system:
    -   A **student's view** would only show their own grades and registered courses.
    -   A **teacher's view** would show the information and grades of all students in the classes they teach.
-   **Purpose:** To tailor the data view for different user groups and to maintain security.

#### 2. Conceptual Level / Logical Level
-   **Description:** This level describes the **logical structure** of the entire database for the whole organization. It is the blueprint that defines **what data** is stored and **how that data is related**, without concern for how it is physically stored.
-   **Example:** An Entity-Relationship (E-R) Diagram showing all relationships between Students, Courses, and Instructors.
-   **Purpose:** To create a unified, central data model for the entire organization, which is the responsibility of the Database Designer.

#### 3. Internal Level / Physical Level
-   **Description:** This is the lowest level, describing **how the data is actually stored on the hard disk**. It deals with all the technical details of storage.
-   **Example:** Defining file structures, creating indexes to speed up searches, specifying data block sizes.
-   **Purpose:** To ensure the most efficient storage and access of data, which is the responsibility of the DBMS and the Database Administrator (DBA).

                        ^
                        | (Physical Data Independence)
                        v
+-------------------------------------------------+
|              Internal Level (Physical)          |
|  (Files, Indexes, Hard Disk Allocation)         |
+-------------------------------------------------+
```

### Data Independence

This three-level architecture enables two powerful features:

-   **Logical Data Independence:** The ability to **modify the Conceptual Schema** (e.g., adding a new column to a table) **without affecting** the External Views or the applications that use them.

-   **Physical Data Independence:** The ability to **modify the Internal Schema** (e.g., switching to an SSD, adding a new index) **without affecting** the Conceptual Schema at all. This allows for performance improvements at the hardware level without disrupting the application's logic.

## üìã Comprehensive Summary & Practical Exercise

### Comprehensive Summary

The three-level database architecture (External, Conceptual, Internal) was designed to manage complexity and achieve Data Independence, allowing different parts of the system to be modified without impacting each other.

### Practical Exercise

Consider an e-commerce system (like Shopee/Lazada):
1.  What architectural level is your view as a "buyer"?
2.  What architectural level is the model that shows all relationships between "users," "products," and "orders"?
3.  At which level is an engineer's decision about what type of server to store product images on?
