# üìñ Topic: Variables and Data Types

## üí° Basic knowledge required

- An understanding of how computers represent data in binary (from Chapter 1).
- A basic grasp of the concept of computer memory (RAM).

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Define "variable" and explain its role as a named reference to a memory location.
- Define "data type" and explain why it is essential for memory allocation and operational correctness.
- Identify and describe common primitive data types (Integer, Float, Boolean, String, Char).
- Differentiate between primitive and composite data types.
- Compare and contrast static and dynamic typing.

### Introduction to Chapter 3

In the previous chapters, we explored the "what" and "why" of programming. In this chapter, we will begin to learn the fundamental "how" by examining the core building blocks that are common to nearly every programming language. We start with the most basic concept: how a program stores and manages information.

### 1. Variables: The Labeled Boxes of Memory

A variable is a named reference to a location in the computer's memory (RAM) where a piece of data is stored. It is like a labeled box where you can store a value. You can change the value inside the box, but the label on the box remains the same.

- Declaration: The act of creating a variable (e.g., `let age;`).
- Assignment: The act of putting a value into it (e.g., `age = 30;`).

```
   Memory (RAM)
+-----------------+
| ...             |
| age -> [  30  ] |  (A box labeled 'age'
| ...             |   holding the value 30)
+-----------------+
```

### 2. Data Types: Defining the Nature of Data

A data type is a characteristic of data that "tells" the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use it. It is like the "type of box," which defines:

- Possible Values: What can this box hold? (e.g., only numbers, or only letters).
- Valid Operations: What can we do with the contents of this box? (e.g., you can add numbers together, but you cannot divide text).
- Memory Representation: How much memory space is needed, and how will the data be stored in terms of bits (0s and 1s)?

Why are data types so important?

1.  Memory Allocation: Different data types require different amounts of memory. Specifying the data type allows the operating system to reserve the appropriate amount of space.

2.  Correctness of Operations: The type system helps prevent errors from meaningless operations. For instance, `5 + 10` is a valid operation, but `"Hello" / true` is an invalid operation.

3.  Data Interpretation: The exact same sequence of bits can have different meanings depending on its data type.

```
  Bit Pattern: 01000001
       |
       +--> As Integer -> 65
       |
       +--> As Char    -> 'A'
```

### 3. Common Primitive Data Types

Most programming languages provide a set of built-in, or "primitive," data types. These include:

- Integer (int): Used to store whole numbers (e.g., -50, 0, 199).
- Floating-Point (float, double): Used to store decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14159).
- Boolean (bool): Used to store a truth value. It has only two possible values: `true` and `false`.
- Character (char): Used to store a single letter, number, or symbol (e.g., 'a', 'Z', '?').
- String (string): Used to store a sequence of characters (e.g., "Hello, World!").

### 4. Composite Data Types

Composite (or complex) data types are built by combining multiple primitive data types. They allow us to group related data together into a single, meaningful unit. Common examples include:

- Array / List: An ordered collection of items of the same type.
- Object / Struct / Dictionary: An unordered collection of key-value pairs.

### 5. Static vs. Dynamic Typing

Languages handle data types in two main ways:

- Static Typing: The data type of a variable is checked at compile-time. You must explicitly declare the type of a variable before you can use it. This approach catches type errors early. (e.g., Java, C++, Rust).
- Dynamic Typing: The data type of a variable is checked at run-time. The type is determined by the value assigned to it, and it can change. This approach offers more flexibility. (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Ruby).

## üìã Comprehensive Summary & Practical Exercise

### Comprehensive Summary

Variables are named containers for data in memory. Data types define what kind of data a variable can hold, which is crucial for memory management and preventing errors. Languages include primitive types (like numbers and booleans) and composite types (like arrays). The enforcement of these types can be either static (checked before running) or dynamic (checked while running).

### Practical Exercise

For each of the following pieces of information, decide which primitive data type would be the most appropriate to store it:

1.  A person's age.
2.  The price of an item.
3.  Whether a user is logged in or not.
4.  A user's last name.
5.  The first letter of a user's last name.
