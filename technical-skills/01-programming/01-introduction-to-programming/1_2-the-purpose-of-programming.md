## 1. Introduction: More Than Just Technical Practice

After understanding what "programs" and "programming languages" are in our previous lesson, the most fundamental question that follows is "Why do we write programs?" Programming is not an end in itself, but rather the most powerful tool humanity has ever created for specific purposes. It is the process of transforming "human intent" into "machine operations" to create tangible results in the real world.

### The Programming Purpose Framework

```
Human Intent to Machine Reality
===============================

Human Problems/Goals

        ▼
  Machine Operations
        │
        ▼
   Real-World Results

Examples:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Human: "I need to process       │
│        1000 photos quickly"     │
│         │                       │
│         ▼                       │
│ Program: Batch image processor  │
│         │                       │
│         ▼                       │
│ Result: All photos resized      │
│         in 2 minutes            │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

Programming serves as a bridge between what humans want to accomplish and what machines can execute, multiplying human capabilities far beyond natural limitations.

## 2. Three Fundamental Goals of Programming

We can summarize all programming goals into three main categories that address different aspects of human needs and limitations.

### Goal 1: Creating Automated Systems (Automation)

This is the oldest and most fundamental goal. Computers have incomparable superiority over humans in performing tasks that are repetitive, have clear patterns, and require high precision. Programming creates sets of instructions to delegate these tasks to computers to do on our behalf.

```
Automation Advantage
====================

Human Limitations          Computer Strengths
─────────────────         ──────────────────
• Gets tired              • Never tires
• Makes errors            • Consistent accuracy
• Slow repetition         • High-speed execution
• Limited attention       • Continuous operation
• Inconsistent quality    • Uniform results

### Goal 2: Solving Complex Problems (Complex Problem-Solving)

Humans have limited capabilities in processing massive amounts of data or performing complex calculations. Programming allows us to create models and simulations to solve problems too large for human intuition to handle.

```
Problem Complexity Scale
========================

Simple Problems          Complex Problems
(Human manageable)       (Requires programming)
      │                         │
      ▼                         ▼
┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐
│ • Basic math│         │ • Climate models│
│ • Shopping  │         │ • DNA analysis  │
│ • Scheduling│    →    │ • Market trends │
└─────────────┘         │ • Traffic flow  │
                        │ • Risk analysis │
                        └─────────────────┘
```
