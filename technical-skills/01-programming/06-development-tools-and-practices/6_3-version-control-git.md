# üìñ Topic: Version Control with Git

## üí° Basic knowledge required

- Basic familiarity with the command line (from lesson 6.2).

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Define "Version Control System" (VCS) and explain its importance for tracking changes and collaboration.
- Define "Git" as a distributed VCS and differentiate it from centralized systems.
- Explain the three main states of Git: Working Directory, Staging Area, and Repository.
- Apply the basic Git workflow: `add`, `commit`, and `log`.
- Understand the concept of remote repositories for collaboration (`push`, `pull`).

### 1. Introduction: The "Save Game" for Your Code

Imagine you are writing a large program. You make a change, and suddenly, the entire program breaks. How do you go back to the last working version? What if you want to see exactly what changes you made yesterday? What if you and a teammate need to work on the same file at the same time?

A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that solves these problems. It is like a "save game" for your project, allowing you to save "snapshots" (called commits) of your entire project at any point in time. This lets you turn back time, compare changes, and collaborate with others without chaos.

### 2. What is Git?

Git is the world's most popular Distributed Version Control System (DVCS).

-   Version Control System: It tracks the history of changes.
-   Distributed: Unlike older centralized systems where the entire history is stored on one central server, with Git, every developer has a full copy of the project's history on their own computer. This makes it fast and allows for offline work.

### 3. The Three States of Git

Git thinks about your files as being in one of three main states:

1.  Modified: The file has been changed but has not yet been saved to the Git database. This is your Working Directory.
2.  Staged: You have marked a modified file in its current version to be included in your next commit (snapshot). This is the Staging Area.
3.  Committed: The data has been securely saved into your local Git database.

Analogy: The Staging Area is like a shopping cart. You browse your project (Working Directory), and when you find a change you want, you put it in the cart (`git add`). Once you have everything you need, you go to the counter to "check out" and permanently record the purchase (`git commit`).

```
+-------------------+
| Working Directory |
+-------------------+
        |
        | (git add)
        |
        v 
+-------------------+
|   Staging Area    |
+-------------------+
        |
        | (git commit)
        |
        v 
+-------------------+
|    Repository     |
+-------------------+
```

### 4. The Basic Workflow

1.  `git init`: Creates a new Git repository in your project. This is done only once per project.
2.  Edit files: You make changes to your code in your code editor as usual.
3.  `git add <filename>`: Moves the modified file to the Staging Area to prepare it for a commit. You can use `git add .` to stage all modified files.
4.  `git commit -m "A message describing the change"`: Takes a "snapshot" of all files in the Staging Area and saves it permanently to the project's history. The commit message is crucial for explaining "why" a change was made.
5.  `git log`: Shows the "ledger" of all commits ever made.

### 5. Collaboration with Remote Repositories

To collaborate, you use a hosting service like GitHub or GitLab to store a central copy of the repository.

-   `git clone <url>`: Downloads a full copy of a remote repository to your machine.
-   `git pull`: Fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local copy.
-   `git push`: Uploads your committed changes from your local repository to the remote repository.

## üìã Comprehensive Summary & Practical Exercise

### Comprehensive Summary

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in a project. It uses a three-stage process (Working Directory -> Staging Area -> Repository) to create snapshots of your work called commits. This allows you to revert changes, view history, and collaborate with others using remote repositories.

### Practical Exercise

Following the steps from the last lesson:
1.  In your `my_project` directory, initialize a new Git repository.
2.  Add the `main.py` file to the staging area.
3.  Commit the file with the message "Initial commit".
4.  View the commit history to confirm your commit was successful.
